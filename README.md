# Movie Webpage

Presentation of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar (2014)

## Purpose

This project was developed as part of my coursework at the University of St Andrews. It was created to fulfill the requirements of a specific assignment. 
The application utilises HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework to create an interface consisting of three html sites presenting movie, director and one of the actors.

As the purpose of this assessment focused on the User Interface, large text parts were filled with placeholder Lorem Ipsum text instead of facts.

Three different versions of the application were created - a responsive version using the Bootstrap framework, a desktop version and a mobile version. 
The static versions were optimised for specific screen sizes and may therefore not present in the intended way when viewing them on a device with different screen sizes.

By including this project in my portfolio, I aim to demonstrate my skills in web development and in using APIs. It serves as an example of my work to potential employers and collaborators.
